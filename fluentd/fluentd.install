	If a more efficient malloc implementation is desired, jemalloc can
	be optionally installed. In order for fluentd to use this, a reference
	to jemalloc is required in LD_PRELOAD environment variable.

	This can be done via 'systemctl edit fluentd.service', and should
	look like 'Environment=LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libjemalloc.so'.
